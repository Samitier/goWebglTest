        <p>
            Hi, my name is Blai Samitier. I'm a software engineer from Barcelona. I love front-end development, 
            UI/UX design and programming videogames.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a self learner, and I'm always trying to learn new tricks and technologies. 
            I think that learning and creativity are two things you should never stop developing.
        </p>
            Please visit my <a href="http://samitier.me/">web portfolio</a> if you want to know me better. 
            I'm always open to talk about anything, so feel free to send me a message!
