        <p>
            Webgl.rocks is an excuse for sharing with you what I learn in my small pet projects about WebGL
            and front-end design.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site is divided in two categories: <b>articles</b>, where I describe how I code, and
            <b>projects</b>, where the finished results will be.
        </p>
